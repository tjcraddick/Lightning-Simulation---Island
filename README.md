# Lightning-Simulation---Island

A project built in Unity Personal Edition with the goal of simulating lightning strikes around the viewer.

More specifically, the goal is to create the lightning through the use of Unity's compute shaders so that the majority
of the work is done on the graphics card and is efficient as a result.

TO DO:
-Build compute shaders for 3-dimensional lightning strikes
-Adapt the simulation for VR headsets and smartphones.

COMPLETED:
-Create basic Unity landmass
